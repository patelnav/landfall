Based on the analysis of the hurricane landfall map for the Florida region, here are 5 specific instances representing the most severe cases of overlapping text labels, making them difficult to read:

1.  **Florida Keys Cluster:** The label 'GEORGES (1998)' is severely overlapped by, and obscures parts of, the labels 'AL101906 (1906)' and 'AL051919 (1919)'. This cluster in the western Keys makes 'GEORGES (1998)' particularly difficult to discern.

2.  **Southeast Florida Cluster (Miami Area):** The label 'ANDREW (1992)' severely overlaps with the labels 'KING (1950)' and 'IRENE (1999)'. Multiple other labels like 'KATRINA (2005)' and 'AL061926 (1926)' are also part of this extremely dense cluster, contributing to the illegibility.

3.  **Central West Coast Florida Cluster (Tampa Bay Area):** The label 'CHARLEY (2004)' severely overlaps with the label 'AL061944 (1944)'. Specifically, the year '(2004)' sits directly on top of the year '(1944)', making both hard to read distinctly.

4.  **Southeast Florida Cluster (North of Miami):** The label 'FRANCES (2004)' severely overlaps with the label 'JEANNE (2004)'. These two hurricanes occurred in the same year and made landfall close together, resulting in their labels being almost superimposed. The label 'AL091948 (1948)' is also partially obscured by this pair.

5.  **Florida Panhandle Cluster:** The label 'ELOISE (1975)' severely overlaps with the label 'DENNIS (2005)'. The text from 'ELOISE (1975)' runs directly into the text for 'DENNIS (2005)'.
