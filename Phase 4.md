Okay, here is the detailed plan for **Phase 4: Evaluation & Hypothesis Assessment**.

**Goal:** To analyze the outputs and logs from Phase 3, compare the final result against the baseline using the defined criteria, check against the budget, and ultimately conclude whether the core hypothesis (that the history-aware agentic loop significantly aids layout automation for this task) is supported by the evidence gathered in this minimal experiment.

**Estimated Cost:** Minimal API cost ($0). Primarily engineer analysis time.

**Key Assumptions for Phase 4:**

1.  **Representativeness of Phase 3:** We assume the observed behavior and final outcome from the Phase 3 run (on the Florida subset, with the chosen parameters/model/strategies) are sufficiently indicative of the agentic loop's potential and limitations for this specific task, even if not exhaustive.
2.  **Clarity of Criteria:** We assume the criteria "no severe overlaps" and "readable labels" are clear enough for the overseeing engineer to make a consistent qualitative judgment when comparing the initial baseline and the final Phase 3 output. "Severe" might be interpreted as labels overlapping >50% of their area or obscuring multiple other labels/points. "Readable" means most labels can be deciphered without significant effort.
3.  **Log Completeness:** We assume the logs captured in Phase 3 contain the necessary information (prompts, full LLM responses including generated code, iteration number, errors, cost data if available) to understand the agent's step-by-step actions and identify patterns or failures.
4.  **Isolating the Variable:** We assume the *primary* driver of any observed improvement (or lack thereof) between the baseline and the Phase 3 final output is the effectiveness of the *agentic loop with history*, acknowledging that `adjustText` provided the initial layout attempt. The evaluation focuses on the agent's contribution *beyond* the basic `adjustText`.

**Steps & Implementation Details:**

1.  **Gather Inputs:** Collect the key artifacts from the previous phases:
    *   `baseline_us_cat1_5.png` (from Phase 0)
    *   The final image generated in Phase 3 (e.g., `output_florida_iter_{N_final}.png`)
    *   The detailed log file(s) from Phase 3 execution.
    *   The record of the total estimated or actual API cost incurred.

2.  **Visual Comparison & Criteria Assessment:**
    *   The overseeing engineer performs a side-by-side visual comparison of the Florida region in `baseline_us_cat1_5.png` versus the *entirety* of `output_florida_iter_{N_final}.png`.
    *   **Assess Baseline:** Note the prevalence of severe overlaps and unreadable labels in the baseline Florida section.
    *   **Assess Final Output:** Evaluate `output_florida_iter_{N_final}.png` against the criteria:
        *   **Severe Overlaps:** Are there significantly fewer instances where labels obstruct each other heavily? Quantify roughly if possible (e.g., "Reduced severe overlaps by ~70%").
        *   **Readability:** Can the majority of the labels on the final map be read clearly? Are there still problematic clusters?
    *   **Overall Improvement:** Make a qualitative judgment: Is the final layout a *demonstrable and significant* improvement over the raw baseline for the plotted region?

3.  **Log Analysis:**
    *   Review the Phase 3 logs chronologically.
    *   **Agent Actions:** What types of code modifications did the agent prioritize? (e.g., overriding specific `ax.text` coordinates, changing `adjustText` parameters, other?). Were the modifications generally targeting areas identified as problematic in the previous image?
    *   **Progress Trajectory:** Did the layout improve steadily, plateau, or oscillate? Were later iterations refining earlier fixes, or constantly tackling new problems? Did the incremental addition of points significantly disrupt previous layouts?
    *   **Error Analysis:** How often did the generated code fail to run? What were the common types of errors (syntax errors, logical errors in plotting)? Did the agent recover or get stuck repeating errors?
    *   **History Usage:** Is there evidence in the logs (e.g., LLM reasoning if captured, or changes made relative to previous step) that the agent used the `previous_image` and `previous_llm_modification` context effectively? Or did it seem to operate only on the `current_image`?
    *   **Efficiency:** How many iterations seemed necessary to achieve noticeable improvements?

4.  **Cost Review:**
    *   Confirm the final `total_estimated_cost` (or actual cost if logged).
    *   Verify if it remained within the $100 budget.

5.  **Synthesize Findings & Hypothesis Assessment:**
    *   Combine the observations from steps 2, 3, and 4.
    *   Address the core hypothesis directly:
        *   **Supported:** If the final layout shows significant improvement meeting the criteria, the agent demonstrably made relevant code modifications over iterations (visible in logs), and the process seemed somewhat stable/convergent, then the hypothesis is supported *for this specific setup*.
        *   **Partially Supported:** If there was improvement but it plateaued quickly, or the agent struggled significantly but still managed some fixes, or if `adjustText` did most of the work and the agent only made minor tweaks.
        *   **Not Supported:** If the final layout was not significantly better than the baseline (or worse), the agent failed to generate useful code modifications consistently, the loop was highly unstable, or `adjustText` alone accounted for any visible clarity.
    *   Identify key limitations observed (e.g., agent struggled with very dense clusters, specific types of code modifications were prone to errors, Flash model limitations, `adjustText` limitations).
    *   Note the final cost and comment on the cost-effectiveness observed.

6.  **Documentation:**
    *   Write a concise summary report detailing:
        *   Project Goal & Hypothesis Recap.
        *   Overview of Methodology Used (Phases 0-3).
        *   Phase 4 Evaluation:
            *   Visual comparison description.
            *   Assessment against criteria (overlaps, readability).
            *   Key findings from log analysis (agent behavior, errors, history use).
            *   Final cost vs. budget.
        *   Conclusion regarding the hypothesis (supported, partially, not supported) with justification based on the evidence.
        *   Key limitations identified.
        *   (Optional) Potential next steps or recommendations if the results are promising (e.g., trying different models, more sophisticated prompts, true diff application, handling larger datasets).

**Expected Outputs:**

1.  A documented analysis comparing the baseline and final map images against the defined criteria.
2.  A summary of key findings extracted from the Phase 3 logs regarding agent behavior, success/failure modes, and iteration progress.
3.  Confirmation of the final project cost relative to the budget.
4.  A concluding statement clearly assessing whether the core hypothesis was supported, partially supported, or not supported by the experimental results.
5.  A brief final report summarizing the project and its findings.

This phase closes the loop, transforming the raw results of the experiment into actionable insights about the viability of this specific AI-driven approach for the defined visualization challenge.
