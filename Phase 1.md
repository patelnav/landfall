#  **Phase 1: Agent Visual Critique POC (Proof of Concept)**:

**Goal:** Verify that the chosen multimodal LLM (Gemini 2.0 Flash Thinking) can accurately identify obvious label overlaps in a small, targeted map snippet and describe potential fixes in text form.

**Estimated Cost:** Very low (~1-2 API calls). Minimal developer time for selecting the snippet and crafting/running the prompt.

**Steps & Implementation Details:**

1.  **Identify Test Snippet:**
    *   The overseeing engineer visually inspects the `baseline_us_cat1_5.png` image generated in Phase 0.
    *   Identify a small region with clear, unambiguous overlaps involving 3-5 landfall labels. Dense areas like South Florida, the Outer Banks, or the central Gulf Coast are likely candidates.
    *   Extract this specific region as a smaller image file (e.g., `test_snippet.png`) using any image editor or programmatically using libraries like Pillow if preferred. Alternatively, note the approximate bounding box coordinates of the region if sending the full image and instructing the LLM to focus there. Sending just the snippet is likely more focused and cheaper.

2.  **Craft the Prompt:**
    *   Create a text prompt designed for a multimodal LLM (Gemini 2.0 Flash Thinking).
    *   The prompt should clearly state the goal: identify label overlaps.
    *   It should instruct the LLM to *describe* the overlaps it sees, referencing the specific labels involved.
    *   Crucially, it should explicitly tell the LLM **not** to generate code, but only to provide a textual description of the problems.
    *   Example Prompt Text:
        ```text
        Analyze the provided image snippet, which shows hurricane landfall labels on a map section.
        Your task is to identify specific instances where text labels are overlapping each other, making them difficult to read.
        List the pairs or groups of labels you see overlapping. For example, "The label 'Hurricane X (YYYY)' overlaps with 'Hurricane Z (YYYY)'."
        Focus only on identifying and describing the overlaps. Do not suggest solutions or generate any code.
        ```

3.  **Execute API Call:**
    *   Use the `google-generativeai` library (or equivalent API interaction method).
    *   Send the crafted prompt *along with* the `test_snippet.png` image data to the Gemini 2.0 Flash Thinking endpoint.
    *   Capture the LLM's text response.

4.  **Evaluate LLM Response:**
    *   The overseeing engineer reads the LLM's textual output.
    *   **Primary Check:** Did the LLM correctly identify the most obvious label overlaps present in the `test_snippet.png` that were selected by the engineer? Does it reference the correct storm names/years involved in the clashes?
    *   **Secondary Check (Ignore for Pass/Fail):** Is the description clear? (We are explicitly *not* judging the quality of any suggested fixes here, just the accuracy of overlap detection).
    *   **Pass/Fail:** This phase is passed if the LLM demonstrates a basic capability to "see" and report the obvious label overlaps accurately within the small test case. If it fails to spot clear overlaps or hallucinates non-existent ones, this indicates a potential issue with its visual interpretation abilities for this specific type of input, which would need consideration before proceeding.

**Expected Outputs:**

1.  A selected image snippet (`test_snippet.png` or identified coordinates) representing a clear case of label overlap from the baseline map.
2.  A crafted text prompt for the LLM.
3.  The raw text response received from the Gemini 2.0 Flash Thinking API call.
4.  A documented engineer assessment (e.g., a simple "Pass" or "Fail" with brief notes) on whether the LLM successfully identified the targeted overlaps based on the response.

This phase acts as a quick, low-cost sanity check to ensure the fundamental visual analysis capability required for the agentic loop exists before investing time in building the more complex loop structure and code generation aspects.
