# Hurricane Landfall Map Label Optimization

Follow my progress in this project [here](https://x.com/patelnav/status/1908371085495533707)!

This project aims to reproduce and optimize the label placement for [Michael Ferragamo's visualization](https://x.com/FerragamoWx/status/1908213794314019049) of 1,167 Atlantic hurricane landfalls (1851-2024):

## Progress So Far

### Phase 3: Full-Scale Implementation ðŸš§
Applied the incremental approach to the full US East Coast map with significant hurricanes. This phase faced challenges with scaling the label placement to handle the increased complexity:

1. **Initial Approach**: Tested sophisticated regional strategies and cluster-based positioning.
2. **Simplified Incremental Approach**: Switched to adding clusters incrementally with adjustText for optimization.
3. **LLM-Guided Point Adjustments**: Implemented a diff-based approach where the LLM identifies and fixes overlapping labels one by one, with each change being applied as a patch to the code.

Current results show the LLM is effectively identifying and repositioning problematic labels, but we need a more systematic approach to achieve Michael's elegant layout:

Key insights from the implementation:
- The LLM successfully identifies and fixes individual label overlaps
- The diff-based approach allows for precise, targeted adjustments
- We need to improve our initial clustering and leader line strategy
- Next focus: Develop better geographic clustering and systematic label placement rules

### Phase 2: AI-Driven Label Placement âœ…
Implemented an agentic loop with Gemini 2.0 Flash Thinking that successfully improved label placement over multiple iterations. The system analyzes overlapping labels in a visualization, generates code changes to fix them, and iteratively improves the layout.

### Phase 1: Visual Analysis with Gemini AI âœ…
Tested if Gemini AI could identify label overlaps in a Florida region map with 116 hurricane landfalls. Both Gemini 2.0 Flash Thinking and 2.5 Pro successfully detected and described the overlaps.

### Phase 0: Baseline Map âœ…
First attempt at plotting all US hurricane landfalls with raw label placement:

   - Implemented agent loop framework for iterative improvements
   - Successfully generated 6 iterations of improving label placement
   - Demonstrated LLM's ability to analyze visualizations and generate code changes

4. **Phase 3: Full-Scale Implementation (In Progress)** ðŸš§
   - Applied to full US coastline with significant hurricanes
   - Implemented diff-based approach for precise label adjustments
   - Successfully generated 10+ iterations of improving label placement
   - Next steps: 
     - Develop more sophisticated geographic clustering
     - Implement systematic leader line placement rules
     - Create region-specific label placement strategies
     - Balance automated clustering with LLM-guided refinements

## Lessons Learned & Next Steps

The project has revealed several challenges in scaling LLM-guided data visualization:

1. **Geographic Context Matters**: Breaking down the problem geographically is essential
2. **Incremental Improvement Strategy**: The diff-based approach allows for precise adjustments but needs better initial placement
3. **Balance of Automation and Guidance**: Finding the right level of structure to provide the LLM remains challenging
4. **Systematic Clustering**: Need to develop better rules for initial label placement and leader line generation
5. **Region-Specific Strategies**: Different coastal regions may need different placement strategies

Future work will focus on:
1. Developing more sophisticated geographic clustering algorithms
2. Creating systematic rules for leader line placement
3. Implementing region-specific label placement strategies
4. Balancing automated clustering with LLM-guided refinements
5. Improving the visual hierarchy of labels and leader lines
